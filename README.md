# Multi-Algorithm-HPO
This is a comprehensive analysis of 5 HPO algorithms- General Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), PyHopper HPO, Bayesian and HyperBand Optimization (BOHB). Our comparison results are posted in our paper.

To execute the code, run requirements.txt file on your system and download the jupyter notebooks given for each Evolutionary Algorithm and other HyperParameter Optimization algorithms.

#  My Contributions
As a collaborator on this project, I was primarily responsible for:

#Implementing the Genetic Algorithm (GA):

Custom crossover, mutation, and selection strategies

Integrated fitness evaluation using ANN performance

#Implementing PyHopper-based HPO:

Used early-stopping and performance monitoring

Tuned hidden layer size, activation functions, and learning rates

#Collaborated on Differential Evolution (DE) and PSO:

Helped structure solution encoding and bound constraints

Reviewed optimizer parameter tuning and comparison plots

#Contributed to DEâ€“BO Hybridization Strategy:

Assisted in design of a combined optimizer architecture

Supported integration testing and analysis
