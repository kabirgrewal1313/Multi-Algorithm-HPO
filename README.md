# Multi-Algorithm-HPO
This is a comprehensive analysis of 5 HPO algorithms- General Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), PyHopper HPO, Bayesian and HyperBand Optimization (BOHB). Our comparison results are posted in our paper.

To execute the code, run requirements.txt file on your system and download the jupyter notebooks given for each Evolutionary Algorithm and other HyperParameter Optimization algorithms.
